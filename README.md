# Diabetes Prediction KNN Model and Web App

![Diabetes Prediction Model](https://github.com/amangupta143/Diabetes-Prediction-KNN/assets/109453339/69e89fbf-683f-461d-8198-9ee2f04c7ab2)

This repository provides a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model `trained_model.sav` for diabetes prediction using patient data, along with a Streamlit web application `Diabetes_Prediction_Web_App.py` for interactive risk assessment.

## Objective
This repository aims to:

- Develop a KNN model to predict diabetes based on patient data.
- Provide a clear and well-structured approach to data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation using a Jupyter Notebook.
- Serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in KNN for diabetes prediction and machine learning for healthcare applications.


## Data
The project utilizes publicly available product and store data, accessible on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database" >Pima Indians Diabetes Database</a>.

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, `Outcome`. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.



## Features

- **Pregnancies :** Number of times a woman has been pregnant
- **Glucose :** Plasma Glucose concentration of 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure :** Diastollic Blood Pressure (mm hg)
- **SkinThickness :** Triceps skin fold thickness(mm)
- **Insulin :** 2 hour serum insulin(mu U/ml)
- **BMI :** Body Mass Index ((weight in kg/height in m)^2)
- **Age :** Age(years)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction :** scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- **Outcome :** 0(doesn't have diabetes) or 1 (has diabetes)


## Model

This repository focuses on building and evaluating a KNN model. KNN classifies data points based on their similarity (distance) to labeled data points in the training set. The model considers the "k" nearest neighbors of a new data point (patient) and predicts the class (diabetic or non-diabetic) based on the majority vote of those neighbors.


## Benefits

This diabetes prediction model offers several advantages:

- **Early Detection:** Identify people at high risk for diabetes, enabling earlier intervention.
- **Improved Management:** Help healthcare professionals tailor treatment plans based on risk.
- **Reduced Costs:** Early detection can potentially lower healthcare costs associated with diabetes.
- **Increased Awareness:** Raise awareness about diabetes risk factors and encourage healthier habits.

These models are not meant for sole diagnosis but can be a valuable tool for risk assessment.


## Getting Started (Jupyter Notebook)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amangupta143/Diabetes-Prediction-KNN.git
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
5. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Diabetes-Prediction-Model.ipynb

**Running the Notebook**

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the notebook and the "diabetes.csv" file.
- Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
- In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the Diabetes-Prediction-Model.ipynb file.
- Run each code cell (block of code) by pressing `Shift + Enter`. The output of the code will be displayed below the cell.

## Using the Web App:
This project also includes a web application built with Streamlit.  Here's how to use it:
1. Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the web application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run Diabetes_Prediction_Web_App.py
4. A web interface will open in your default browser, allowing you to enter patient data and receive a diabetes risk prediction.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to this repository! If you have ideas for improvement, bug fixes, or want to explore different aspects of the model, feel free to create a pull request.
